NanoSat MO Framework
This repository contains a website with fundamental information for learning
more about  the [NanoSat MO Framework], a software framework for nanosatellites
based on CCSDS Mission Operations services.

The NanoSat MO Framework introduces the concept of apps in space that can be
started and stopped from ground. Apps can retrieve data from the platform
through a set of well-defined MO services. Many possibilities for extensions
are available due to its modular and flexible design approach which is not
limited to the space segment but extends down to ground by providing all the
building blocks for a complete and free end-to-end solution.

A Software Development Kit (SDK) is available in order to facilitate the
development with the [NanoSat MO Framework].
